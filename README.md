##TO-DO :worried:
- When on edit reservation page, change "edit reservation" link to home page link
- When a user creates a new reservation it updates the original quantity if one exists instead of creating a new reservation
- Update the look of the website
- No way of user reserving tickets for a show a week out in advance only for that day
